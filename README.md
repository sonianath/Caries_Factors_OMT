# Caries_Factors_OMT
=======
This file describes the analysis the Oral Microbiome Transplantation (OMT) study, conduceted from 2021-2023. OMT involves tranfer of oral microbiota from a healthy donor to a recipient with oral disease. Before OMT can be done, we need to select donors suitable for caries prevention. For super donor selection 93 super healthy participants were sampled and their sociodemographic, lifestyle, dietary factors, and oral health behaviors was studied in relation to oral microbiome. This would help identify which of the factors has a signicant impact on super donor selection for dental caries prevention.
